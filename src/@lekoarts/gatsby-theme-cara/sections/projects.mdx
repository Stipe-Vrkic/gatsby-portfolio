 Frameworks have become an essential part of web development, as the standards of web applications are always rising, so does the complexity of the technology needed.

 and interactive web applications.

  It is highly essential to choose the right backend technology. I mostly used <b>.Net</b> and <b>Oracle Sql</b>.
